    "The purpose of this project is to compare the spread of the influenza virus among the Michigan State University campus and several other college campuses. The college campuses we are analyzing are Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, California State University Fullerton (largest college campus), and Alaska Bible Study College (smallest college campus). We accomplish this goal using an agent-based model (ABM) to represent each location with the population density for the model dependent on the actual population and size of the location.\n",
    "# Define necessary functions #\n",
    "Here we import our necessary libraries and define the functions that will be needed to create our ABM model to demonstrate the spread of the influenza virus on each college campus."
