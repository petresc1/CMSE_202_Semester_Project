CMSE 202 Semester Project
Group Members: Isabel Petrescu, Jacob Marquez, Benjamin Johnson, Garrit Hotchkiss
The purpose of this project is to compare the spread of the influenza virus among the Michigan State University campus and several other college campuses. We accomplish this goal using an agent-based model (ABM) to represent each location with the population and size for the model comparable to the actual population and size of the location.
The code can be run simply by opening the provided Jupyter notebook, assuming the imageio library is installed.
