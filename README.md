The purpose of this project is to compare the spread of the influenza virus among the Michigan State University campus and several other college campuses. We accomplish this goal using an agent-based model (ABM) to represent each location with the population density for the model determined by the actual population and size of the location. Each member of the population is assigned 25 square feet such that the population density can be calculated by multiplying the population by 25 (to represent 25 square feet per person) then dividing by the campus area in square feet.</p>
<p>
The code can be run simply by opening the provided Jupyter notebook, assuming the imageio library is installed. The code will also create 2 new directories called "images" and "gifs" in order to store the images and gifs created by running the ABM model.</p>
